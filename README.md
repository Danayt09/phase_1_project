# Aviation Data Analysis

## Author: Danayt Aman, Heath Jones, and David Hartsman

### Overview

In this project, we analyzed a dataset composed of 90,000+ FAA records. The original data contained information from reports, or events where something harmful transpired. The data contained reports from a variety of different aircrafts. In many cases, the data were quite persuasive in displaying the enhanced safety of certain aircrafts over others.

### Business Problem

Our task was to provide advice and insight to a business group that intends on entering the aviation industry, specifically about airplanes. Our team spent the week examining the last 20 years of accident reports, with the aim of identifying the safest airplane models and manufacturers. We decided to focus on the past 20-year period because it represents post-9/11 data, and we felt that our clients would be primarily interested in assessing modern airplanes, as opposed to outdated, less technologically advanced planes. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we focused our research on three distinct industry sectors: aerial application, private planes, and commercial planes. This allowed us to delve deeper into the specific safety considerations within each sector and provide useful recommendations.

### Data 

The data had records dating back to 1948. Every record corresponded to an official report by the FAA. The information in the reports pertained to the number of people on board, both injured and uninjured, the status of the plane, the purpose of the flight, and many other pieces of information. In many cases, the records were missing information, sometimes only for a few columns and sometimes for many fields of an entry. 

### Methods

We filtered through the dataset, removing entries from vehicles that were not airplanes. We also created categorical columns, dropped certain extraneous information, and imputed selected missing values. We employed inferential statistics to draw meaningful insights from a sample of more than 100 different specific airplanes that occurred most often in our data. This statistical approach allowed us to make reliable determinations and draw conclusions about the safety of various airplane models and manufacturers. We examined several critical factors, including fatality rates, injury severity, weather resistance, and aircraft structural resilience.

### Conclusions

We have concluded our strongest recommendation for commercial airplanes are/is the <AIRPLANE#1> from the large commercial sector. It has an excellent performance record based on <REASONS>. Our recommended plane in the small/private aircraft industry is the <PRIVATE PLANE>. Factors we considered are <FACTORS!>, as well as <EVEN MORE FACTORS?!?!!>. For aerial application, we recommend the Grumman 164 and the Air Tractor 301. These planes earned our recommendation because of their exceptional  record for limiting deadly accidents and for rarely being totally destroyed. They both performed well in assessments related to weather as well. In summary, we conducted extensive data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and attempted to identify key stats to track to evaluate the quality of different airplanes.  The three airplanes we determined to be best in class are: <small>, <large>, and the Grumman 164 and Air Tractor 301 for aerial application. These planes compared favorably to other models in their industry, and we feel that we can offer our strong recommendation.

    We found <THESE THREE VISUALIZATIONS ,(aerial application craft will likely be a 2 column damage/fatality chart)> to be particularly instructive. After studying the relationships in these charts, we arrived at our conclusions with a high degree of conviction.     
    
    We arrived at our eventual conclusions cleaning the data, establishing criteria for measuring safety, and comparing aircrafts to other aircrafts in their respective industries.
    
  
We examined several critical factors, including fatality rates, injury severity, weather resistance, and aircraft resilience. These factors play a pivotal role in determining the overall safety of an aircraft.

Our team has defined a safe aircraft recommendation based on these factors. We believe that an aircraft can be deemed safe if it exhibits low fatality and less injury severity in accidents. Additionally, we considered the aircraft's weather resistance, its ability to navigate through adverse weather conditions. For instance, a high rate of accidents occurring during VMC where the weather is favorable for visual flight rules, would indicate a lack of safety. Conversely, aircraft with lower accident rates in such conditions are considered safer.

We employed inferential statistics to draw meaningful insights from a sample of 100 data points and extend our findings to the larger dataset. This statistical approach allowed us to make reliable inferences and draw conclusions about the safety of various aircraft models and manufacturers.
Our data is limited in a sense that we only explored accident reports and we donâ€™t know the total flight record to compare.
